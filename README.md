# VAT

The **VAT** (Visualization, Analysis, Transformation) is a web-based GIS application, powered by Geo Engine (https://www.geoengine.de), an open-source project. It enables users to visualize, analyse and transform geospatial vector and raster data without requiring deep GIS knowledge. The VAT is based on the open-source Geo Engine project (https://vat.gfbio.org).
